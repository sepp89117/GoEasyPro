# GoEasyPro
With this program you can control and monitor several GoPros at the same time. In addition, the SD card can be accessed and stored videos can be played.

This requires a NodeMCU with ESP8266 running the code "GoPro_UDP2_HT" you can find it in my repositories.

The MAC addresses (in Form1) of the cameras need to be changed for it to work.

Any missing libs can be found under / bin / debug
